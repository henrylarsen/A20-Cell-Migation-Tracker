# A20-Migration-Tracking
This project was started after hearing about research conducted on A20 cancer cells, qualitatively 
studying their rate of movement before and after treatments. This is made with intent of being able to
quantify the rate of migration. 

Current state: Using OpenCV integrated with Python to manipulate the images to isolate each individual cell.

Next step: Detect the centroid of each cell.
